<p align="justify"> Monitoring nutritional intake is very important because it is critical for maintaining the overall health and well-being of both children and adults, given the importance of nutrition to both physical and mental health. So, knowing their nutritional intake allows them to better understand their own health status. </p>

<p align="justify"> Nutrinometer is a program designed to assess user‚Äôs daily nutrient intake. It is aligned to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) by promoting Good Health and Well-Being. The program will encourage users to make healthier food choices and develop more balanced and sustainable eating habits. By promoting healthy eating habits, the program can help reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer.

It is also included in the program to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's data for achieving their nutritional goals. By tailoring recommendations to each user's specific needs, the program can help promote sustainable and long-term behavior change.</p>
