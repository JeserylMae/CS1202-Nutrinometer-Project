<p style= "font-family: courier new;">
Monitoring nutritional intake is very important because it is critical for maintaining the overall health and well-being of both children and adults, given the importance of nutrition to both physical and mental health. So knowing their nutritional intake allows them to better understand their own health status.

Nutrinometer is a program designed to assess user’s daily nutrient intake. It is aligned to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) called “Good Health And Well-Being”. This program will indicate the nutrients found in the food the user has consumed and will provide analysis whether they had attained the advisable amount of daily nutrient intake.
